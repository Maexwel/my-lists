# Web structure project
## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide Ã  High-level and customizable structure of React app.
Here are the main principles bootstraped :
* Component structure
* Redux structure and configuration
* Routing structure
* UI base kit configured
* Remote service configuration (http)

## Libraries
First of all, thanks to all of those libraries that this project is using :
* **react** (base library)
* **react-router-dom** (routing)
* **core-js** and **react-app-polyfill** (polyfills)
* **prop-types** (type checking)
* **redux** and **react-redux** (redux setup)
* **axios** (http requests)
* **@material-ui/core** and **@material-ui/styles** and **@material-ui/theme** (ui base kit)

## Base files structure
```
* root
    * *public
        - index.html (entry point)
        - web.config (configuration file for IIS hosting)
        - robot.txt
        - ...png (favicon.ico, ... project base icons)
    * src
        * assets (folder for static assets)
        * components (folder for React components)
            * ui-kit (base directory for the ui-kit of the application)
        * router (folder for routing logic)
            - routes.js (constant file with all the routes)
            - index.js (base router using all routes)
        * service (folder for remote service)
            - constants.js (constant file with all the remote routes)
            - ...Service.js (file containing promises to CRUD data from remote)
        * tore (folder containing redux's store)
            * actions
                - constants.js (constant file for all actions)
                - ...Actions.js (Redux's action file)
            * reducers
                - reducer.js (main reducer containing all the reducers)
                - ...Reducer.js (Redux's reducer file)
            - index.js (redux entry point)
        * theme
            - theme.js (base theme file used to set the base colors)
    - package.json
```
## Installation
    git clone https://github.com/Maexwel/web-structure.git <-destination-name->
    git remote set-url origin <-you-git-remote-url->
    npm i

## Components structure
The component structure is really simple : 

```
* components
    * ui-kit
```

The goal is to create all base ui-kit components inside the ui-kit folder.
For example, if you create a Button component, this button should be in **/components/ui-kit/Button**.
Like this you can have reusable ui components easily configured.
Be aware, those ui components should only be there for ui, they should'nt contain the logic of the app inside.

## Redux structure and configuration
The redux structure and configuration is this one :
```
* store
    * actions
        - constants.js
        - ...Actions.js
    * reducers
        - reducer.js
        - ...Reducer.js
    - index.js
```

If you want to create a new Reducer, here are the steps :
1. Create the constants for you reducer in **/store/actions/constants.js**
2. Create an action file in **/store/actions** containing the actions
3. Create the reducer in **/store/reducers** using a switch for you created actions's constants
4. Include your reducer inside the **/store/reducers/reducer.js** file
5. Here you are, you can now use you redux store everywhere in your components by connecting theme !

## Routing structure
